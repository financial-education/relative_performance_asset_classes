* Introduction

In this interactive presentation we'll get an idea of how different asset classes perform.  The various classes we'll look at are:

1.  Short-term US government debt
2.  Long-term US government debt
3.  Short-term risky debt
4.  Long-term risky debt
5.  Equity


* Background

<!---The main holders of each asset class
as well as the size of each market -->

* Pull and Visualize Data

Below we will pull data on the above asset classes, and calculate holding period returns.  We will then plot and compare these returns.

#+begin_src R :cache yes :session *R* :results none :exports none
library(quantmod)


tbill3mo <- getSymbols('TB3MS', src='FRED', auto.assign=FALSE)
nasdaq <- getSymbols('NASDAQCOM', src='FRED', auto.assign=FALSE)


#+end_src


<!---plot each asset class over any time interval
pull data from FRED -->
